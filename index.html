                <p class="Info-text One">The Porsche 911 GT3 RS is a high-performance,
                    <br>track-focused version of the 911 sports car. 
                    <br>It features a naturally aspirated 4.0L flat-six engine producing around 518 hp, 
                    <br>a lightweight chassis, aggressive aerodynamics, and rear-wheel drive. 
                    <br>The GT3 RS is designed for maximum performance on both road and track, 
                    <br>with advanced suspension, a large rear wing, and extensive use of carbon fiber. 
                    <br>It also includes Porsche’s PDK dual-clutch transmission for lightning-fast shifts.
                    <br>The latest model offers advanced aerodynamics, including active aero elements,
                    <br>and an F1-style drag reduction system (DRS). It’s one of the most extreme road-legal 911s ever made.
